# Calculator Application

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Structure

```
├── calculator.html   # The HTML file for the calculator's user interface
├── styles.css        # The CSS file for styling the calculator
├── script.py         # The Python file for handling backend calculations (optional)
├── README.md         # This README file
```

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- User-friendly interface with buttons for number input and operations.
- Responsive design to fit different screen sizes (using CSS).
- Backend calculations handled by Python (if applicable).
  
## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator's interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator to look modern and user-friendly.
- **Python (optional)**: Handles calculations on the backend.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
cd calculator-app
```

### 2. Run the Application

#### If you are using only HTML and CSS (no backend):

1. Simply open `calculator.html` in a web browser:

   ```bash
   open calculator.html
   ```

#### If you're using Python for backend calculations:

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended).
   
2. Run the Python script (e.g., with Flask or another web framework to serve the application):

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you have configured) to access the calculator.

## File Descriptions

- **`templates/index.html`**: This file contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers and operations.
- **`static/style.css`**: This file provides the styling for the calculator, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **`static/app.js`**: This JavaScript file manages the logic for handling user interactions such as button clicks, updating the display, and performing calculations on the client side.
- **`app.py`**: This Python file is the main backend, using Flask to process calculation requests from the frontend and return the results. It serves as the bridge between the user interface and the logic.
  
## How to Use the Calculator

1. Enter numbers using the buttons or your keyboard.
2. Select the operation (addition, subtraction, etc.).
3. Press the equal button (`=`) to see the result.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for advanced mathematical functions (square root, exponentiation, etc.).
- Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.
- Add unit tests for the Python backend.

## Acknowledgements

- The design is inspired by classic calculator interfaces.
