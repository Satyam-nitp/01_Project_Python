# Calculator Application

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- User-friendly interface with buttons for number input and operations.
- Responsive design using CSS to fit different screen sizes.
- Backend calculations handled by Python (Flask).

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator's interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator to look modern and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Handles client-side logic, including button clicks and display updates.
- **Python (Flask)**: Manages backend processing and serves the web application.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
cd calculator-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask Application

Run the Flask app (`app.py`) locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Calculator

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the calculator.

## File Descriptions

- **`app.py`**: This Python file is the main backend, using Flask to process calculation requests from the frontend and return the results.
- **`templates/index.html`**: This file contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers and operations.
- **`static/styles.css`**: This file provides the styling for the calculator, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **`static/app.js`**: This JavaScript file manages the logic for handling user interactions such as button clicks, updating the display, and performing calculations on the client side.

## How to Use the Calculator

1. Enter numbers using the buttons or your keyboard.
2. Select the operation (addition, subtraction, etc.).
3. Press the equal button (`=`) to see the result.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for advanced mathematical functions (square root, exponentiation, etc.).
- Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.
- Add unit tests for the Python backend.

## Acknowledgements

- The design is inspired by classic calculator interfaces.
